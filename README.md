## Auto-encoder based Image-Similarity Engine

- Builds a simple Convolutional Auto-encoder based Image similarity engine.
- This solves the problem of finding similar images using unsupervised learning. There are no labels for images.

Tasks that it can do.

- [x] Similar images using Auto-encoders.
- [x] Similar image search from image features.
- [x] Clustering similar images.

![Output 2](outputs/query_image_0/image_sim_op2.png)

More outputs can be found in outputs folder.

## Models

- Some models trained using a sample dataset are given in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T6uS4O7LiuGMtXlRSMFmKAEDNQ08Ry25?usp=sharing) link.
- It contains encoder, decoder and numpy embeddings generated from auto-enocoders.
- These are obtained by running `torch_train.py` script.
